# Triangle Cloner
Anagram for "Learning React"

## What is this?
This is an attempt to implement the React library from scratch using TypeScript.

## Why?
Because I want to expand my knowledge about the library. And the best way to understand something is implement it yourself.

## Who inspired you?
I've come across [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Kc2REHdwnQ) from Rodrigo Pombo, and that lit a fire in my head.

## How is it build?
I'm using [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to bundle my files, and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) to be able to use my library with JSX.

## How do I run it?
- Install the node dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
- Run the project
```bash
npm run dev
```
